# Project information
* I started this project on 23/07/2023 while working through [Chad Darby's Spring and Hibernate Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-hibernate-tutorial/)
* You can find my main repo for this course [here](https://github.com/shivkumar98/Spring_and_Hibernate_Course)

# üõ†Ô∏è Project Requirements üõ†Ô∏è

* For this project, I needed to create a RESTful API which connects to a database. Here are the requirements:
* We need to create a REST API for the Employee directory

* The API must be able to handle the following HTTP methods:

| HTTP Method                       | CRUD Action            |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `POST` `/api/employees`             | Create a new employee  |
| `GET` `/api/employees`              | Retrieve employees     |
| `GET` `/api/employees/{employeeId}` | Retrieve an employee via ID |
| `PUT` `/api/employees/{employeeId}` | Update and employee via ID |


## üìà Development Plan üìà
1) Set up database dev environment
2) Create Spring Boot project using Spring Initialzr
3) Get list of employees
4) Get single employee via ID
5) Create a new employee
6) Update an existing employee
7) Delete an existoing employee

* I have been provided sample data from [employee-directory.sql](/sample-data/employee-directory.sql)
